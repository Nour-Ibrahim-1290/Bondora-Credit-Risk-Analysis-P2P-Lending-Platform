## 1. Reuirenment & Analysis
1.1 Introduction
1.2 About Data
1.3 Tools and Technologies

### 1.1 Introduction
- [**Bondora**](https://www.bondora.com/) is investment platform, which connects between investors and investees which includes Peer-to-peer lending.
- Peer-to-peer lending has attracted considerable attention in recent years, largely because it offers a novel way of connecting borrowers and lenders. But as with other innovative approaches to doing business, there is more to it than that.
- In this project we will be doing credit risk modelling of peer to peer lending Bondora systems.

### 1.2 About Data
- Data for the study has been retrieved from a publicly available data set of a leading European P2P lending platform  ([**Bondora**](https://www.bondora.com/en/public-reports#dataset-file-format)).
- The retrieved data is a pool of both defaulted and non-defaulted loans from the time period between **1st March 2009** and **27th January 2020**.
- The data
comprises of demographic and financial information of borrowers, and loan transactions.In P2P lending, loans are typically uncollateralized and lenders seek higher returns as a compensation for the financial risk they take.
- In addition, they need to make decisions under information asymmetry that works in favor of the borrowers.
- In order to make rational decisions, lenders want to minimize the risk of default of each lending decision, and realize the return that compensates for the risk.

### 1.3 Tools & Technologies
- During this project we're using python for performing the analysis process.
- Pandas module for Data Preprocessing
- Pandas, numpy, matlpotlib.pyplot, and seaborn for EDA.
- Pandas, numpy, PCA for Feature Engineering.
- Pandas, numpy, sklearn, pickle for Modeling, and Pipelining
- flask for App development.
- AWS - EC2 for Deployment.
